# Car Insurance Claim Prediction Project

This project uses logistic regression to find the single best predictor of car insurance claims from a customer dataset. It demonstrates practical data science skills including data cleaning, feature selection, model evaluation, and visualization.

## Project Overview
- **Goal:** Identify the single feature that best predicts whether a customer will make a claim on their car insurance, using logistic regression and accuracy as the metric.
- **Dataset:** Provided by On the Road car insurance, containing various customer and vehicle attributes.
- **Techniques:** Data cleaning, feature engineering, model evaluation, and visualization.

## Workflow
1. **Data Import & Exploration:** Load and inspect the dataset, check for missing values and data types.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Fill missing values and encode categorical variables.
3. **Feature Selection:** Fit logistic regression models for each feature and compare accuracy.
4. **Visualization:** Display model fit and confusion matrix for the best feature.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data wrangling and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis
- Feature selection and model evaluation
- Visualization with matplotlib and seaborn
- Documentation and reproducibility

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
2. Open `notebook.ipynb` and run the cells in order.

## Results & Progress
- **Best Feature Identified:** `driving_experience`
- **Model Accuracy:** 78%

This quantifies my progress in feature selection and model evaluation. The project demonstrates my ability to extract insights and build effective predictive models.

## Portfolio Reflection
This project is a milestone in my data science journey, showing my ability to apply statistical modeling and communicate results effectively. I continue to learn and improve, and welcome feedback from the community.
